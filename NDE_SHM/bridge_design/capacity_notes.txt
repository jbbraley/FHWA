steel at strength
	composite: capacity = plastic moment capacity, therefore will be computed as moment at first concrete crushing (top of deck)
	non-comp: capacity = moment at first yield (girder)
	partial comp: maximum of first crushing and first yield
	

prestressed at strength
	composite: capacity = plastic moment capacity, therefore will be computed as moment at first concrete crushing (top of deck) or yielding of strands (0.9Fu).
	non_composite: capacity = plastic moment capacity, first crushing at top of girder or strand yielding
	partial comp: (check top of girder & top of deck for crushing)

	strands are breaking before crushing at top of deck
