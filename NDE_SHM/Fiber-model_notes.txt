General Description
The cross section is descritized into "fibers" with associated stress-strain relationships.
For a given axial load, curvature is imposed and forces are computed for individual fibers. 
Equilibrium equations are used to check the total force is equal to the applied force. 
The centroidal strain is adjusted until the sum of forces equals the applied force.
The moment is computed by multiplying the individual fiber forces by their moment arm (or distance to extreme fiber)
The curvature is incrementally varied to produce a moment-curvature curve.
f1(x)-f1(x+a)=(f1-f2)(x)+f2(a)


Meeting notes
send back revised report
by end of july both local (fiber) models and global (FE) models
August: use models to investigate deterioration parameters
Go back and use field data, scale to meet sensitive bounds and evaluate effect on load ratings
6-7 weeks to understand deterioration parameters effects, plus another month to investigate in context of real data.
Possible case bridges:
	Virginia pilot bridge (haymarket)
	IBS
	BEAST specimen 1

Info bridge not publicly accessible
Jalinoos wants "stacks"
Could also be sent to FHWA for selecting other possible bridges
No issues from fhwa
will send out revised report and schedule
Aug 5th? conference call; plan on discussing initial data
To extend to October. Expand the schedule to end in November/December.
