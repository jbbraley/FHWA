deck reinforcement?
material properties (i.e deck strength)

percent non-composite
	1. find deck force at deck crushing
	2. hold total deck force constant while continuing to vary curvature (i.e. optimize with constraint that deck force = value)
	3. what is capacity now, still crushing at top fiber?

non-composite: suggest not include bending of deck, and therefore capacity w/o deck
